# Active Bias - Training More Accurate Neural Networks by Emphasizing High Variance Samples
Unofficial tensorflow implementation of [*Active Bias*](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/6701-active-bias-training-more-accurate-neural-networks-by-emphasizing-high-variance-samples). We implemented *SGD-WPV (SGD Weighted by Prediction Variance)*, which is one of the methods using the concept of high variance in the paper.
